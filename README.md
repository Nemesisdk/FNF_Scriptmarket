# FNF_Scriptmarket
for mission makers from FNF to go and grab premade configs and settings for streamlined mission making
Full credit to each mission maker for submissions to the github


FNF mission guidelines:
Guidelines is as follow: - December 21th

- You use the presented presets for both uniforms and weapons - if you wish to make changes in said presets, you get approval from vetting team. (WIP to add more)
- You should only make changes to config, description and game mode file within the template/mission folder. (See above)
- Give vetting team a few lines on how you think the mission will play out, what considerations did you have to balance etc. 
- Mark custom areas/buildings and such on the map, it takes time but is necessary. More accurate the better.
- No mixing vanilla and RHS weapons in the same mission without prior approval.
- Blufor/Opfor/Grnfor Units - don’t mix factions and/or weapons/assets.
- Make sure the uniform choices are not similar - there should be a clear distinction between the chosen factions. 
- No night missions without NVGs. The NVG settings in ace, should be discussed with vetting team and allow for “good sight” and not a challenge. 
- K.I.S.S. - it often iterate into better gameplay, than the other way around.

Making missions for FNF is a privilege and such privilege can be taken from you.

To give the channel value and unify our work a bit:
- Present if you are working on a mission: map, game mode and factions(who is attacking and defending), what event you wish to see it played in.(date and EU/NA/any)
- You can discuss ideas, scripting and such, but try not to share more meta than necessary.
